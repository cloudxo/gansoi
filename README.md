Gansoi
======

Gansoi is a modern monitoring solution inspired by classical network monitoring
software (Nagios and friends) updated to modern and best practices.

### Disclaimer and Current State

At the moment this software is unusable for anyone but early adopters
and developers. It's a just-working proof-of-concept.

#### Current Limitations

- No useful agents implemented yet.
- The web interface is rudimentary at best. Useless at worst.

#### What We Currently Have

- A distributed core implemented using [Raft](https://raft.github.io/) and
  [BoltDB](https://github.com/boltdb/bolt).
- Full encryption of internal cluster communication using an internal
  [CA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority).
- The project requires nothing but a Go compiler when building. There
  is no runtime dependencies.
- A simple [Slack](https://slack.com/) notifier.
- A few example agents for testing.
- [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) support for the web interface.
- It's quite performant. The smallest cloud server we could rent can easily
  handle hundreds of checks per second. With no optimizations yet.

### Design goals

- [x] Fault tolerant and distributed - should tolerate multiple node failures
  with no single point of failure.
- [ ] Performant - should scale to thousands of checks per second on basic
  hardware.
- [x] Zero dependencies - should install and operate without any other
  software.
- [x] Geodistributed - should be deployable across the globe for full
  redundancy and geographically distributed checks.
- [ ] Multidimensional severity grouping - an alert should be categorized in
  both severity and urgency.
- [ ] No false positives - the system should never cry wolf.
- [x] Easy encryption - should support Letâ€™s Encrypt out of the box.
- [x] Future-proof - Everything must support IPv6 out of the box.

#### Alert integrations

- [x] Slack - it's what we all use and love.
- [ ] Pagerduty - oldtimers swear by this. Let's support it.
- [x] Email - CEO's want their alerts too.
- [ ] Twilio voice calls - for waking up your ops team at 3 AM.

#### Transports

Checks could be self-contained and run on a Gansoi node - or they can run on a
third party host. This will require a transport.

- [x] ssh - Gansoi should support SSH as a transport. It is universally supported
  as a remote access protocol. Gansoi must support some form of keep-alive to
  avoid the constant reconnecting and handshake.
- [ ] NRPE - This is the *industry standard* and we should support it.

### Building and development

Go 1.6 or newer is required for building Gansoi.

`go get ./...` should get all dependencies.

`go build .` should be enough to build Gansoi.

You can run a small local Gansoi cluster for testing and development:

    $ ./test3.sh

A three-node local cluster will be started shortly. You can visit the web
interface at https://gansoi-dev.com:9002/.
